# student_notekeeper

Me and my adhd have gotten very frustrated that even within one faculty different professors use different services for teaching: between moodle, mamph, personal websites and youtube channels I spend first two months every semester organizing bookmarks in my browser toolbar. So I have written this app to keep all links to various resources of each lecture/seminar/whathaveyou in one place.

## Getting Started

There is only APK in releases, it requires no permissions, has no access to the internet, and, well, is opensource.  
PRs with improvements are welcome, as are issues and suggestions.  
  
Coded in anger, refactoring may be required :)  
  
## Installation

Just grab an apk from [latest](https://github.com/Goshagosha/student_notekeeper/releases/latest) release

## Compilation
First of all you want [flutter](https://flutter.dev)

### Android
`flutter build apk --split-per-abi`  
`flutter install`
