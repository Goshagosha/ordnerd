<h1>Privacy Policy for the service Ordnerd</h1>
<p>Last updated: November 2, 2021</p>

<p>Any personal information you provide when creating a "Lecture" object – which is the main functionality provided by
    Ordnerd – will be stored at Firebase Firestore service.</p>

<p>We collect email and password you provide, to enable you to uniquely authenticate with the Ordnerd. The
    authentication is done through the Firebase Authentication service, and therefore your email and password will be
    stored there.</p>
<p> Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user authentication, and facilitate end-user account management.
    It also uses user-agent strings and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and
    authentication.</p>
<p>Firebase Authentication keeps logged IP addresses for a few weeks. It retains email and password until the Firebase
    customer initiates deletion of the associated user, after which data is removed from live and backup systems within
    180 days.</p>

<p>You have the right to withdraw consent and have your personal data deleted. If you wish to exercise this right,
    please contact us at junkboxdev@gmail.com</p>

<p>The web version of Ordnerd is hosted with the Firebase Hosting. Firebase Hosting records IP addresses of visitors.
</p>
<p>Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect abuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage
    data.</p>
<p>Hosting retains IP data for a few months.</p>

<p>Firebase Firestore, Firebase Authentication and Firebase Hosting are services provided by Google (google.com). We do
    not share any of your personal data with third parties other than Google's Firebase services, which, as described
    above, are necessary for Ordnerd to function.</p>

<h3>Camera</h3>

<p>Ordnerd may request access to your device's camera if you decide to use QR scan feature, but it does not store or
    send visual data, and only processes data obtained from QR code localy.</p>
